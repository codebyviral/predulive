                <h2>Autonomous Flight: The Power of AI in Drones</h2>
                <p>Drones are becoming increasingly autonomous, thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)
                    and machine
                    learning. These cutting-edge technologies enable drones to make intelligent decisions based on data
                    from sensors and
                    other onboard systems, allowing them to fly and perform tasks without direct human intervention.

                        <p>Using AI algorithms, drones are now able to intelligently plan their routes, optimizing for
                            factors such as fuel
                            efficiency, weather conditions, and potential obstacles. This capability is particularly

                <!-- <img src="./assets/img/para3.jpg" alt="Blog 1"> -->
                <p>
                    One of the key challenges facing drone technology is the limitation of flight time due to battery
                    life. Researchers and
                    manufacturers are constantly working on developing drones with extended flight times, allowing them
                    to stay airborne for
                    longer periods of time. This is particularly important for applications like package delivery and
                    long-range
                    surveillance.

                            A notable innovation in extending drone flight time is the development of solar-powered
                            drones. Companies like
                            ByeAerospace are collaborating with SolAero Technologies to create drones that operate using
                            high-efficiency solar
                            cells. These cells support up to 350 watts of energy production per square meter of surface
                            area, and their power
                            efficiency increases in high-altitude, low-temperature conditions.
